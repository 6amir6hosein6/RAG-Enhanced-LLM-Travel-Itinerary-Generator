Misty Pasand Forest

Scenic places in Gilan and Mazandaran

One of the beautiful sights in northern Iran is the Misty Pasand Forest.

Foggy areas have always been full of mystery, and since our eyes cannot clearly see objects in the fog, it can be quite scary. If you plan to travel to the northern forests and Mazandaran and are looking for mysterious places and spooky attractions around Tehran, visit Behshahr County. Pasand Forest is one of the untouched and pristine spots in northern Iran. The beautiful village of Pasand and the Pasand Rose area are located exactly three kilometers east on the right side of the highway next to the Pasand River, marked by a large sign.
